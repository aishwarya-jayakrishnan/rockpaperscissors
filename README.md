# rockpaperscissors
The classic rock, paper, scissors game against computer generated moves. The game largely works of conditional loops.

The comments in the source code explain each part of the code clearly.
User move is obtained by the user, and a random computer generate move is generated. Both the moves are then compared with each other to establish whether the game is:
1. Won by the user
2. Lost by  the user
3. Tied
